Hanukkah of Data is a set of short data challenges released over 8 days of Hanukkah in 2022. The [same fictional dataset](data.md) is used for all puzzles. Explore this dataset with the tools of your choice to figure out the answers and light the Hanukkah candles.

## How to Play

When you first come to the puzzle page, there is only one candle: the [_shamash_](day0). Click on its wick to read the introduction and read the question. When you submit the correct answer, the _shamash_ will be lit, and the first candle will appear. Solve this puzzle to light its candle too.

Each day, there will be another candle and therefore another puzzle, for 8 days. Each candle will illuminate a part of the tapestry, until the whole tapestry is lit.
